# Portfolio

This is my portfolio website built with [astrojs](https://www.astro.build). The commands section was
thankfully provided by them (as part of their default README).

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build the production site to `./dist/`          |
